            <p>JavaScript isnt Java. There! With that clarification out of the way, you can move on to bigger, more
                important learning, like how to make cool sliders. In all seriousness, JavaScript is one implementation
                of a specification known as ECMAScript.  learn more about ECMAScript later in this chapter.
                Where did JavaScript come from? You might not know the rich and storied history of JavaScript—
                and you might not really care much about it, either. If thats the case, you might be tempted to jump
                ahead to the next chapter and begin coding JavaScript. Doing so, of course, would be a mistake—
                you miss all the wonderful information that follows in this chapter. And understanding a bit about
                the history of JavaScript is important to understanding how the language is implemented in various
                environments today.
                JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape sometime in 19996. Back
                then, the language was called LiveScript. That was a great name for a new language—and the story
                could have ended there. However, in an unfortunate decision, the folks in marketing had their way,
                and the language was renamed to JavaScript. Confusion soon ensued. You see, Java was the exciting
                new language at the time, and someone decided to try to capitalize on Jav popularity by using
                its name. As a result, JavaScript found itself associated with the Java language. This was a disadvantage for JavaScript, because Java, although popular in the sense that it was frequently used, was also
                unpopular because it had earned a fairly bad reputation—developers used Java in websites to present
